# Parallel Dynamic SSSP Update Framework using MPI and METIS

üöÄ A high-performance parallel framework for updating Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP) in large-scale dynamic graphs, based on the paper _"A Parallel Algorithm Template for Updating Single-Source Shortest Paths in Large-Scale Dynamic Networks."_ This project is developed as part of our Parallel & Distributed Computing course.

## üìå Overview

This project explores an efficient two-phase approach to update SSSP trees incrementally in dynamic graphs, instead of recomputing from scratch. We analyze the proposed CPU and GPU implementations, and outline a hybrid parallelization strategy using:

- **MPI** for inter-process communication
- **OpenMP/OpenCL** for intra-node parallelism
- **METIS** for efficient graph partitioning
